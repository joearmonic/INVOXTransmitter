Out Of The Dark
I spent my life in the shadows
Creepin' round the corners
Trying to find a home to land
I've spent my nights feeling lonely
Dreaming of what could be
But this is where I take my stand
I might be nervous, but I'm an optimist
It's an adventure, ready to take the risk
Looking for monsters, looking for family
Could this be what I've been waiting for?
This is what I've been waiting for
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark (oh, oh)
Not afraid to show my secrets or my scars (oh, oh)
This is where I'm finally free
This is where I'm meant to be
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark
Out of the dark
So this is it, back at school still living by his rules
How can I find somewh?re to breathe?
I'm not a king, that's him and no on? tells him no
I just need a chance to find my wings
I might be nervous but I'm an optimist!
It's an adventure
Ready to take the risk
I see the monsters
They look like family
This is what I've been waiting for
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark (oh, oh)
Not afraid to show my secrets or my scars (oh, oh)
This is where I'm finally free
This is where I'm meant to be
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark
Out of the dark
I might be nervous but I'm an optimist
It's an adventure
Ready to take the risk
I see the monsters
They look like family
This is what I've been waiting for
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark (oh, oh)
Not afraid to show my secrets or my scars (oh, oh)
This is where I'm finally free
This is where I'm meant to be
Here I am
I'm coming out of the dark
Out of the dark

There's a new way
Everybody has a place
Run through the halls now

Three Of Us
So I've been hiding the truth
'Cause I know they don't approve
But now I'm spilling my secrets around you
Felt like I didn't belong
Part of a pact, now a song
Goodbye to living a lie, now I found you
Putting the pieces in place
So good to finally say
It's like
Oh, we'll be making them believe in us
Oh, we can own it just by being us
Put us all together, there's no getting in our way
You're messing with the three of us
Taking some of our partes
Using our brains and our hearts
Now finally someone is speaking my language
I like not being afraid
We gotta do it our way
Don't need permission from the world to change it
Putting the pieces in place
So good to finally say
It's like
Oh, we'll be making them believe in us
Oh, we can own it just by being us
Put us all together, there's no getting in our way
You're messing with the three of us
It's like
Yeah, after everything that we've been through
Yeah, taking the power back to live our truth
Put us all together, there's no getting in our way
You're messing with the three of us
Put us all together
Put us all together
Put us all together
There's no getting in our-
Put us all together
Put us all together
Put us all together
There's no getting in our
Way, way, way
Put us all together, there's no getting in our way
You're messing with the three of us

True Monster Heart
Have you ever heard the story
Of dear old Mr. Hyde?
Half human, and half monster
Whom everyone despised
It's a cautionary tale
That should never be forgotten
His secret was his undoing
Then things turned out really rotten
Give me a beat!
 
Mr. Hyde, he tried and tried
To fit in with his kind
Monsters hated the human, Jekyll
And humans hated the monster, Hyde
Could you imagine being both and neither at the same time?
Mr. Hyde, he was truly cursed
Cause we know monsters are the best, yeah
And humans are the worst, blech
 
Humans are the scariest,
Smelliest and hairiest
They're all a bunch of creepy freaks
We're the coolest of the cool
We all know that monsters rule
Clap along if you agree!
 
Don't be afraid to show your true monster heart
Don't be afraid to show your true monster heart
OK, OK, Okay-yay
Go ahead and let it out
You know it's time to shout
Do what us monsters do, we'll show you
 
True (Show you)
True monster heart
 
M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Show them who you really are!
H-U-M-A-N-S
Humans are the worst, and we're the best, hey!
 
Mr. Hyde was put on trial
His crime? Hiding the truth (truth)
No one would believe him,
Cause his heart was half untrue (untrue)
Rules are rules, and when monsters chose
To enforce the rules, it got gruesome (it got gruesome)
No one ever had his back, Hyde was shunned,
That's a fact, they were scared cause he was half human (wow) Ugh
 
Humans are unbearable
Altogether terrible
Just a bunch of freaky creeps
Humans smell like dirty socks
We all know that monsters rock!
Clap along if you agree
 
Don't be afraid to show your true (you rule) monster heart
Don't be afraid to show your true (your true) monster heart
OK, OK, Okay-yay
Go ahead and let it out
You know it's time to shout (time to shout)
Do what us monsters do, we'll show you
 
True (Show you)
True monster heart

Here I Am
Here I go
Now's the time
Hold my breath
I'll be alright
Today's the day
I finally say
Here I am
I won't be afraid
Here we go
Comin' out the shadows, yeah, I'm confident
Finally I'm here and I'm lovin' it, woah
I don't have to hide
Can't believe I'm here, yeah, I finally made it
My heart is beating crazy, and I feel amazing, woah
Now this is my time
Here I am
There's no turning back
Here I am
I know where I'm at (hey, hey, hey) (Where I'm at)
Nothing left to hide, I'm coming alive
These are my monsters and this is my vibe
Here I am
(Hey, hey, hey)
Here I am
Everybody's so sophisticated
Turns out being human's so overrated, woah
I'm on a new adventure
Now I'm feelin' so great
I'm really lovin' this place
I'm surfing down these halls like I'm riding a wave, woah
This is the best place ever
Here I am
There's no turning back (hey, hey, hey)
Here I am
I know where I'm at (hey, hey, hey) (Where I'm at)
Nothing left to hide, I'm coming alive
These are my monsters and this is my vibe
Here I am
I am (hey, hey, hey)
Here I am

I Can Trust you

Asking for a friend who's got some insecurities
Acts like he's so confident but it's just make-believe
Wanting to be myself but it just ain't easy for me
(You mean your friend?)
Right, he wants to feel less like he's some kind of freak
Something 'bout when I look in your eye-eye-eyes
(You?)
Yeah
Makes me feel like I can be my real self
Ohhh, I'm so sick of tryna be somebody else
Can I tell the truth?
Feel like I can trust you
Had a lot of fake friends in my life who never had my back
(Oh, yeah?)
But I can tell that ain't you
(Who would ever, who would ever do a thing like that?)
Ooh, feel like I can count on you
(Yeah, feel the same way, too)
I, I, I
Something 'bout when I look in your eye-eye-eyes
Makes me feel like I can be my real self
Ohhh, I'm so sick of tryna be somebody else
Can I tell the truth?
Feel like I can trust you
I, I, I
Something 'bout when I look in your eye-eye-eyes
Makes me feel like I can be my real self
Ohhh, I'm so sick of tryna be somebody else
Can I tell the truth?
Feel like I can trust you

Spark
Pretty sure this is better than sunlight
What's the opposite of panic attack?
Wanted badly to know what this feels like
It's the best feeling that I've ever had
The adrenaline has got my heart pounding
Any harder, I think it would explode
Unbelievable, I finally found it
Hope the human half of me doesn't show
I knew it was inside
But now, it's time
I swear I just saw a spark, it's not even dark
I've never felt more free, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark, here's the scary part
I've never felt more me, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark
Might sound crazy if I said it was magic
I don't know how else to categorize
My priority for me since I found it
Is to water it, so it never dies (oh)
But now (but now), it's time
I swear I just saw a spark, it's not even dark
I've never felt more free, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark, here's the scary part
I've never felt more me, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark
I swear I just saw a spark, it's not even dark
I've never felt more free, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark, here's the scary part
I've never felt more me, mm-mm-mm
I swear I just saw a spark

No Apologies
Won't hide behind a lie another single day
Won't run away, I won't pretend
I'm confident and strong, I'll always be okay
I'll never doubt myself again
This is me, so here I am
Not ashamed, come and catch me if you can
What you see is what you get now
And I won't change a thing
Yeah, I'm sorry, I ain't sorry
'Cause I like being me
So no more waiting on the sidelines
No more hiding on the inside
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
Say no more, don't need your approval
What for? Breaking all the rules so
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
No one's built quite perfectly
But who cares, I am everything I need
Fitting in is overrated
So don't just play some part
Never copy, duplicate it
Just be who you are
So no more waiting on the sidelines
No more hiding on the inside
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
So no more waiting on the sidelines
No more hiding on the inside
No apologies (oh-oh)
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
Say no more, don't need your approval
What for? Breaking all the rules so
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
So no more waiting on the sidelines
No more hiding on the inside
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me
Say no more, don't need your approval
What for? Breaking all the rules so
No apologies
Love it or hate it, I'ma just be me

This is Who I Am
I know what it's like to hide in the shadows
Never let anyone open up the doors or look through the windows
All my life I have been waiting so long
To embrace the light and find somewhere that I can belong
And come out of the darkness
I'm ready now
Ready now
I look around and see a world that's waiting for me
Where I can fit in and make some real friends
I'm gonna run through the halls
I wanna do it all
Seize my moment
I wanna own it
I've always dreamed of a perfect place like this
Where I'm not afraid to be seen
Oh and I can just be me
This is who I am, oh
And it feels like for the first time
My life can begin, oh
So I'll step out into the light
'Cause this is where I'm meant to be
And I don't have to hide
This is who I am, oh
And I feel like for the first time I fit in
I fit in
I feel so high off the ground and
I feel my heartbeat, it's poundin'
Finally he don't wanna ever leave
'Cause now I know where I'm supposed to be
This is who I am, oh
And it feels like for the first time
My life can begin, oh
So I step out into the light
'Cause this is where I'm meant to be
And I don't have to hide
This is who I am, oh
And I feel like for the first time I fit in
